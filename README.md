### Goal: Data Analytics & Business Intelligence.

Hey everyone!!ðŸ‘‹ 

Thanks for visiting my page! I was in traditional marketing for a while until I had to take some time off to take care of personal "stuff". Now, it's time for me to set my sights on another lofty goal by turning my hobby into a new career. 

I am currently studying to complete my Bachelors in Business Administration while learning *Data Analytics* on my own. I'm taking baby steps, and I'm here to supplement my course work, practice, and get my hands dirty with projects and other things I can do to help out wherever I can! With time, practice, and the help of this awesome community, I'm confident I can get 'er done!

#### About Me:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my BBA specializing in Marketing & IT 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning **Data Analysis**, **Data Science**, and **Analytics**, still on the fence about **Business Intelligence**.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects and contests as my skills improve. 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ADHD productivity and study hacks!! I may need some help with coding Python and higher math, maybe calculus. It depends on what is required.

- âš¡ Fun fact: Always a creative, I studied artðŸŽ¨in my preteens, and music as a classical voice major ðŸŽ¶ in junior college. I was a touring gospel singer in my teens and 
      young adulthood. Now, my artistic passions are focused on the visual arts, especially pastels and painting.
